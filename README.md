The starter code renders a list of movies, as links that can be clicked to find out more about the movie.
Your task is to refactor the app to reduce the code duplication.
You can do this by filling in the `Movie` and `MovieList` components, and then rendering a `MovieList` with appropriate props inside the `App` component.
When you're done, `App` should render the exact same output thing, but using the `Movie` and `MovieList` components rather than the hardcoded JSXÂ inside of the App component.
